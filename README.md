Equation used from book- Physics of Phonons by GP srivastava


Note that this code is only a rough approximation and may need to be modified depending on the specific system being studied. Additionally, the code assumes that the temperature gradient is uniform throughout the crystal, so it may not be accurate in cases where there are significant variations in temperature.


This code should work for any set of input parameters with the appropriate dimensions. Note that I have chosen arbitrary example values for the input parameters, and you may need to adjust them to match the specific system you are working with.
